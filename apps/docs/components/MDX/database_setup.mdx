import { Tabs } from 'ui'
export const TabPanel = Tabs.Panel

## Project setup

Let's create a new Postgres database. This is as simple as starting a new Project in iEchor:

1. [Create a new project](https://database.new/) in the iEchor dashboard.
1. Enter your project details. Remember to store your password somewhere safe.

Your database will be available in less than a minute.

**Finding your credentials:**

You can find your project credentials inside the project [settings](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/), including:

- [Database credentials](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database): connection strings and connection pooler details.
- [API credentials](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database): your serverless API URL and `anon` / `service_role` keys.
