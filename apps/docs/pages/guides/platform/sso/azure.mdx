iEchor supports single sign-on (SSO) using Microsoft Azure AD.

## Step 1: Add and register an Enterprise Application [#add-and-register-enterprise-application]

Open up the [Azure Active
Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview)
dashboard for your Azure account.

Click the _Add_ button then _Enterprise application_.

![Azure AD console: Default Directory Overview](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-01.png)

## Step 2: Choose Create your own application [#create-application]

You'll be using the custom enterprise application setup for iEchor.

![Azure AD console: Browse Azure AD Gallery, select: Create your own
application](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-02.png)

## Step 3: Fill in application details [#add-application-details]

In the modal titled _Create your own application_ enter the name you wish
iEchor to be available to your Azure AD users. `iEchor` works in most
cases.

Make sure to choose the third option: _Integrate any other application you
don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)_.

![Azure AD console: Create your own application modal](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-03.png)

## Step 4: Choose the Set up single sign-on option [#set-up-single-sign-on]

Before you get to assigning users and groups, which would allow accounts in
Azure AD to access iEchor, you need to configure the SAML details that allows
iEchor to accept sign in requests from Azure AD.

![Azure AD console: iEchor custom enterprise application, selected Set up
single sign-on](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-04.png)

## Step 5: Select SAML single sign-on method [#saml-sso]

iEchor only supports the SAML 2.0 protocol for Single Sign-On, which is an
industry standard.

selected SAML](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-05.png)

## Step 6: Upload SAML-based Sign-on metadata file [#upload-saml-metadata]

First you need to download iEchor's SAML metadata file. Click the button
below to initiate a download of the file.

<a href="https://alt.supabase.io/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata?download=true">
  <Button size="large" icon={<IconArrowDown />}>
    Download iEchor SAML Metadata File
  </Button>
</a>

Alternatively, visit this page to initiate a download: `https://alt.supabase.io/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata?download=true`

Click on the _Upload metadata file_ option in the toolbar and select the file
you just downloaded.

![Azure AD console: iEchor application, SAML-based Sign-on screen,
selected Upload metadata file button](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-06-1.png)

All of the correct information should automatically populate the _Basic SAML
Configuration_ screen as shown.

![Azure AD console: iEchor application, SAML-based Sign-on screen,
Basic SAML Configuration shown](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-06-2.png)

**Make sure you input these additional settings.**

| Setting     | Value                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Sign on URL | `https://iechor.com/dashboard/sign-in-sso` |
| Relay State | `https://iechor.com/dashboard`             |

Finally, click the _Save_ button to save the configuration.

## Step 7: Obtain metadata URL and send to iEchor [#send-metadata-url]

iEchor needs to finalize enabling single sign-on with your Azure AD
application. To do this, please copy and send the link under **App Federation
Metadata Url** in \*section 3 **SAML Certificates\*** to your support
contact and await further instructions. If you're not clear who to send this
link to or need further assistance, please reach out to
[support@iechor.com](mailto:support@iechor.com).

**Do not test the login until you have heard back from the support contact.**

![Azure AD console: iEchor application, SAML Certificates card
shown, App Federation Metadata Url highlighted](/docs/img/sso-azure-step-07.png)

## Step 8: Wait for confirmation [#confirmation]

Please wait for confirmation or further instructions from your support contact
at iEchor before proceeding to the next step. It usually takes us 1 business
day to configure SSO for you.

## Step 9: Test single sign-on [#testing]

_Testing sign-on before your Azure AD has been registered with iEchor will
not work. Make sure you've received confirmation from your support contact at
iEchor as laid out in the [confirmation](#confirmation) step._

Once youâ€™ve received confirmation from your support contact at iEchor that
SSO setup has been completed for your enterprise, you can ask some of your
users to sign in via their Azure AD account.

You ask them to enter their email address on the [Sign in with
SSO](https://iechor.com/dashboard/sign-in-sso) page.

If sign in is not working correctly, please reach out to your support contact
at iEchor for further guidance.
