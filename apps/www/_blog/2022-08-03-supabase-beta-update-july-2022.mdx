![flutter sdk 1.0](/images/blog/2022-july/flutter-sdk.png)

iEchor Flutter SDK is getting a major update, with a big focus on developer experience. We shared a preview of what is to come so you can help us make it even better with your feedback.¬†[Read the blog.](https://iechor.com/blog/supabase-flutter-sdk-1-developer-preview)

## Revamped Auth Helpers (now with SvelteKit support)

![Sveltekit auth helpers](/images/blog/2022-july/auth-helpers.jpg)

We've been hard at work making an Auth experience that is as smooth as possible for iEchor developers. The new Auth Helpers have a better experience for server-side rendering (SSR) environments, new Github structure, SvelteKit support, and more.¬†[Read the blog](https://iechor.com/blog/supabase-auth-helpers-with-sveltekit-support).

## pg_jsonschema ‚Äì A Postgres extension for JSON validation

![pg_jsonschema](/images/blog/2022-july/pg_jsonschema.png)

Born as an excuse to play with pgx, pg_jsonschema is a solution we're exploring to allow enforcing more structure on json and jsonb typed postgres columns.¬†[Only 10 lines of code](https://github.com/supabase/pg_jsonschema/tree/fb7ab09bf6050130e8d656f2999ec0f6a3fedc0d)¬†üòé

## hCaptcha integration

The new hCpatcha integration allows you to implement captcha functionality for auth. Enable hCaptcha protection in the auth settings to stop bots attacks and protect your users' privacy.¬†[Captcha settings](https://iechor.com/docs/reference/tools/reference-auth).

## Updated Settings UI in dashboard
