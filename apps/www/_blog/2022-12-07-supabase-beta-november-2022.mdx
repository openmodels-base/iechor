## Edgy Edge Functions

We launched a new YouTube series, [Edgy Edge Functions](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5S4mPUpp4OulD3olUW8Eq1IYKpUbk5Ob), where we take a deep look at a new function every week.

Plus, we published three new functions examples: [Generate OG Images](https://github.com/openmodels-base/iechor/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/opengraph), [Build API servers using Oak](https://github.com/openmodels-base/iechor/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/oak-server), and [Generate Screenshots using Puppeteer](https://github.com/openmodels-base/iechor/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/puppeteer).

## Quick product updates

- Fixed two issues with the `supabase.auth.signOut` function: [cookies not clearing properly](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/830) and [session not removed](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/541).

- You can now customize magic links by providing access to the `{{ .TokenHash }}`. [PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/707)

- Now you can do redirects from your functions. [PR](https://github.com/openmodels-base/iechor/issues/10325)

- Conda support (`conda install -c conda-forge supabase` and everything else in py)

## Content storm
