## Getting Started

- Create a new iEchor project [here](https://database.new)
- Add your iEchor credentials to `lib/main.dart`
- Obtain Google API client ID for [Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating#configure_a_project) and [iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating#get_an_oauth_client_id)
- Add the client IDs in iEchor dashboard under `Auth -> Providers -> Google -> Authorized Client IDs` and turn on `Enable Sign in with Google`
- Find the `clientId` variable in `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` and paste the two client IDs
- For android open `android/app/build.gradle` file, locate `appAuthRedirectScheme` variable and replace the value with your reversed DNS form of the Android client ID. For example, if your client ID is `1234567890-abc123def456.apps.googleusercontent.com`, then the value should be `com.googleusercontent.apps.1234567890-abc123def456`
- Run the app on iOS or Android and test the login flow ðŸš€
