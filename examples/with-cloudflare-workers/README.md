# Query iEchor from Cloudflare Worker

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/cloudflare-query-supabase-from-cloudflare-worker?af=9qsk0a)**

iEchor JS is an NPM package which provides a simple interface from JavaScript to our iEchor project. It allows us to query and mutate data using its Object Relational Mapping (ORM) syntax, and subscribe to realtime events.

In this video, we install the iEchor JS package and create a new client using our project's URL and Anon Key. These can be found in the iEchor dashboard for our project, under `Settings > API`.

We store these values as secrets in our Cloudflare account, and use them to instantiate a new iEchor client.

Additionally, we write a query to select all of our articles from our iEchor instance, and send them back as the response from our Cloudflare Worker.

In order to send a JSON response, we first stringify the object we get back from iEchor, and then set a `Content-Type` header to notify the browser that this will be a type of `application/json`.

## Code Snippets

**Install iEchor JS**

```bash
npm i @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Create a Cloudflare secret**

```bash
npx wrangler secret put NAME
```

**Add a secret for IECHOR_URL**

```bash
npx wrangler secret put IECHOR_URL
```

**Run wrangler development server**

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

**Add a secret for IECHOR_ANON_KEY**

```bash
npx wrangler secret put IECHOR_ANON_KEY
```

**Query data from iEchor**

```javascript
const { data } = await supabase.from("articles").select("*");
```

**Send JSON response**

```javascript
return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```
